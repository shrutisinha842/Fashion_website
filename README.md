fashion e-commerce website template, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is likely designed with stylish and visually appealing layouts to showcase fashion products. Since itâ€™s not responsive, it means that the design does not adapt to different screen sizes, such as mobile devices or tablets, which could result in elements overlapping, excessive scrolling, or misaligned content on smaller screens.

Here are some key characteristics of your website:

HTML Structure: You probably used HTML to structure the webpage, organizing sections such as the header, product listings, and footer. It might include product images, descriptions, prices, and buttons for adding items to a cart or viewing details.

CSS Styling: The CSS you used most likely defines the appearance of your website, such as colors, fonts, product grid layouts, and hover effects on buttons or images. It might be a fixed-width design that looks good on desktop screens but lacks flexibility for various devices.

JavaScript Functionality: JavaScript is likely implemented to add interactivity, such as dropdown menus, product filters, or an image carousel for featured items. However, the lack of responsiveness could limit the user experience on mobile, making the interactive elements difficult to use on smaller screens.

Since it's not responsive, the layout may not automatically adjust based on the screen size, and the overall usability of the website could suffer on devices like smartphones or tablets.
